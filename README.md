### Number Guessing Game
* **Description:** 
This task involved building a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number within a user-specified range (1-10, 1-100, 1-1000, or 1-10000). The player then tries to guess the number by entering their own guess. The game provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is "too high" or "too low." The player continues guessing until they successfully identify the hidden number.
* **Solution:**
1-Random Number Generation:
The program utilizes the srand() function to seed the random number generator with the current time, ensuring a different random number for each game.
The rand() function then generates a random number within the chosen range based on the user's input.

2- User Input and Guessing Loop:
The program prompts the user to select the desired range for the hidden number.
The user's guess is obtained through standard input.
The program compares the guess to the randomly generated number.
If incorrect, the program provides feedback ("too high" or "too low") and prompts the user for another guess.
This process repeats until the user successfully guesses the hidden number.

3- Game Loop:
The program allows for multiple rounds of the guessing game.
After each round, the user is asked if they would like to play again.
The game continues as long as the user chooses to play.

### \ A command-line file manager
* **Description:** This task (if applicable) involved creating a command-line file manager application. This application would allow users to perform basic file management operations such as:
Navigating directories
Viewing file listings
Creating new directories
Copying or moving existing files

* **Solution:**
The filesystem library is utilized to interact with the file system.
Key functions from the library, such as directory_iterator, create_directory, copy, and rename, are employed to implement the desired functionalities.

1- Command-Line Interface:
The program presents a simple command-line interface, displaying the current directory and prompting the user to enter commands.
Supported commands include:
list: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
view <file>: Displays the contents of a specified file.
mkdir <directory>: Creates a new directory.
copy <src> <dest>: Copies a file from the source to the destination.
move <src> <dest>: Moves a file from the source to the destination.
exit: Exits the program.

2- Error Handling:
The program incorporates error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle potential exceptions, such as file not found, permission denied, or disk full errors.
Informative error messages are displayed to the user in case of failures.

3-Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The command-line interface is intuitive and easy to use.
Core File Operations: The application supports essential file management operations like listing, viewing, creating, copying, and moving files.
Error Handling: The program is robust and handles potential errors gracefully.
File System Library: The filesystem library provides efficient and cross-platform file system operations.

### AI Chatbot
* **Description:** This task involved creating a basic AI chatbot capable of understanding and responding to simple user inputs. The chatbot can recognize keywords and phrases related to emotions, programming, and general inquiries.
* **Solution:**
 1- Keyword-Based Response:
The chatbot uses a simple keyword-based approach to identify user intent.
It checks the input for specific keywords or phrases, such as "how are you," "happy," "sad," "programming," and "C++."
Based on the detected keywords, the chatbot selects and outputs an appropriate response.

 2- Input Handling:
The getline function is used to capture the user's input as a string.
The if and else if statements are used to check for specific keywords or phrases within the input string.

 3- Response Generation:
The chatbot generates responses based on predefined templates or rules.
If the input doesn't match any recognized keywords, a generic response is provided.

Limitations:
The chatbot's responses are limited to predefined templates and lack true natural language understanding.
It cannot handle complex queries or engage in meaningful conversations.
The chatbot's knowledge base is limited to the specific keywords and phrases it is programmed to recognize.
Future Improvements:

To enhance the chatbot's capabilities, consider incorporating more advanced techniques such as:
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Using NLP techniques to analyze the semantic meaning of the user's input.
Machine Learning: Training a machine learning model on a large dataset of conversations to improve the chatbot's ability to generate more natural and contextually relevant responses.
Dialog Management: Implementing a dialogue management system to track the conversation history and maintain context.
